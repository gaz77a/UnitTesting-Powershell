# Unit testing Powershell scripts

This repository shows a way to unit test `Powershell` scripts using `Pester` and `Husky.NET`

1. [Getting Started](.docs/getting-started.md)
1. [Pester v3 vs v5](.docs/pester-v3-vs-v5.md)

## Background

Powershell has a built-in unit testing tool `Pester`.
<br>Note: The built-in version of `Pester` is `v3` rather than the latest which is `v5`.
